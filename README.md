# Functional-Coverage-of-Priority-Encoder
Designed and validated a Priority Encoder module with comprehensive functional coverage. The encoder translates an 8-bit input vector into a 3-bit output, representing the highest priority active input. The design uses a case statement with wildcard patterns to handle various input scenarios and determine the correct output based on the highest set bit. The testbench for this design includes a detailed coverage group that monitors different input patterns and corresponding outputs to ensure complete verification. Each input pattern, ranging from a single active bit to multiple active bits, is tested to validate the encoderâ€™s accuracy. Coverage points are specified to capture all possible states of the input and output, ensuring robust validation of the encoder's functionality and correctness across diverse conditions.
